I conducted sentiment analysis on selected Emily Dickinson poems using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. This computational method quantified the sentiment scores for each poem, identifying the overall emotional tone. For example, "Wild Nights – Wild Nights!" had a notably negative sentiment score, suggesting themes of longing and unfulfilled desire. Conversely, "I cannot live with You" had a high positive sentiment score, reflecting a complex emotional attachment. The analysis highlighted specific passages, such as "I cannot live with you – / It would be life," as significant due to their strong emotional content and relevance to the overall sentiment. These passages were identified as important because they encapsulate key emotional shifts and thematic elements, providing deeper insights into Dickinson's exploration of complex emotions.
